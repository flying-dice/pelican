     * A UUID is a unique 128-bit value, stored as 16 octets, and regularly formatted as a hex string in five groups. UUIDs are used to assign unique identifiers to entities without requiring a central allocating authority.
     *
     * They are particularly useful in distributed systems, though can be used in disparate areas, such as databases and network protocols. Typically, a UUID is displayed in a readable string form as a sequence of hexadecimal digits, separated into groups by hyphens.
     *
     * The uniqueness property is not strictly guaranteed; however, for all practical purposes, it can be assumed that an unintentional collision would be extremely unlikely.
     *
     * ### Which UUID version should I use?
     * If you just want to generate unique identifiers, then consider version 4 (v4) UUIDs. If you want to use UUIDs as database keys or need to sort them then consider version 7 (v7) UUIDs. Other versions are not supported and should generally be avoided unless thereâ€™s an existing need for them.
     *
     * ## TypeScript Example
     * {@includeCode ../uuid.example.ts}
     *
     * ## Lua Example
     * {@includeCode ../uuid.example.lua}
     *
     * @summary Provides functions for generating UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers).

     * The `logger` module provides a simple logging utility for Lua, allowing you to log messages at different levels (debug, info, warn, error).

     * This module is useful for debugging and monitoring your Lua applications by providing a consistent way to log messages with timestamps and severity levels.
     *
     * It supports namespaced logging, allowing you to create loggers with specific namespaces for better organization of log messages.
